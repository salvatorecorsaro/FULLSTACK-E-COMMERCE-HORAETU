In this project I aimed to develop an ecommerce webapp.
Horaetu is a brand I created for this project it comes from the greek concept of HORAE (seasons) and tu (you), the brand offer products to help you along the different stages of everyone life.
The idea of HORAETU the logo and the products you will see are all originally created for this project.
I thought about developing a microservice structure dockerized in order to ensure encapsulation and agile development.
There are a total of 11 services used by the app. 
A chatbot was developed using python, tensorflow and flask trained using Machine Learning (Deeplearning) and a custom dataset collected by me.
I containerized custom dockers for the mySQL databases.
Security is managed by OKTA service to assure a solid system. (I custom crafted security in my previous projects)
