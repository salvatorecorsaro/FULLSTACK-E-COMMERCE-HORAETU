all services deployed on dockers sql aswell enjoy it at http://horaetu.herokuapp.com/

The services are hosted on heroku and with the plan Iá¸¿ currently using they may go sleep if not being requested for 30+ minutes. so the first call may be slow to respond but after that it will go up and react as designed.

Being hosted with a free plan in the future you may experience some problem in using the app. 
For this reason I will give you instruction to deploy the app locally and test it.

In this project I aimed to develop an ecommerce webapp.
Horaetu is a brand I created for this project it comes from the greek concept of HORAE (seasons) and tu (you), the brand offer products to help you along the different stages of everyone life.

The idea of HORAETU the logo and the products you will see are all originally created for this project.
I thought about developing a microservice structure dockerized in order to ensure encapsulation and agile development.
There are a total of 11 services used by the app.

A chatbot was developed using python, tensorflow and flask trained using Machine Learning (Deeplearning) and a custom dataset collected by me.
I containerized custom dockers for the mySQL databases.

Security is managed by OKTA service to assure a solid system. (I custom crafted security in my previous projects).


##Instructions for local deploy:

For a fast test local it's possible to just mount the front service by downloading the angular project and make it run locally on port 4200. ( command: ng serve)
this way it will automatically connect to the database and the other services on the cloud.
